## How to Use

### Running Locally

1. **Simple HTTP Server (Python)**
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Simple HTTP Server (Node.js)**
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000`

3. **VS Code Live Server**
   - Install "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"

### Using the App

1. Click **"Start Listening"** to activate your microphone
2. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
3. Play or sing a note
4. Watch the real-time pitch detection and visualization
5. Toggle between **Spectrogram** and **Tuner** modes
6. Adjust settings via the gear icon

## Algorithm Details

### Pitch Detection
Uses **autocorrelation** algorithm for accurate pitch detection:
1. Captures audio buffer from microphone
2. Calculates RMS to detect silence
3. Performs autocorrelation to find fundamental frequency
4. Uses parabolic interpolation for sub-sample accuracy
5. Applies smoothing to reduce jitter

### Visualization
- **Spectrogram**: Real-time frequency spectrum with color-coded intensity
- **Tuner**: Waveform display showing audio signal shape

## Browser Compatibility

✅ Chrome/Edge (recommended)  
✅ Firefox  
✅ Safari (iOS 11+)  
✅ Opera

**Requirements:**
- HTTPS or localhost (required for microphone access)
- Modern browser with Web Audio API support

## Performance

- **Low latency** - Real-time processing with minimal delay
- **Efficient** - Uses Web Audio API for native performance
- **Smooth animations** - 60 FPS canvas rendering
- **Small footprint** - No dependencies, ~50KB total

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Recording and playback
- [ ] Pitch history graph
- [ ] Multiple tuning systems (equal temperament, just intonation)
- [ ] Transposition support
- [ ] Export pitch data
- [ ] Dark/light theme toggle
